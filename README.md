# Best Buy Cloud-Native Application Demo - Final Lab Assignment CST8915

## üì¶ Project Overview

This cloud-native application simulates Best Buy‚Äôs online cloud-native application, using a microservices architecture. The application supports product browsing, ordering, admin operations, and order fulfillment. It also features AI-powered product description and image generation using GPT-4 and DALL¬∑E.

This project is a customized version of the **Algonquin Pet Store (On Steroids)** architecture, with key improvements:
- Slightly modified the store-front and store-admin user interface to reflect best buy related products
- Replaced RabbitMQ with **Azure Service Bus**
- Added AI-Service using **Azure OpenAI (GPT-4 + DALL¬∑E)**

## üß± Application Architecture

![Best buy cloud native demo Architecture Diagram](./assets/best-buy-demo-cloud-native.png)

The architecture consists of multiple microservices deployed on a Kubernetes cluster:

| Component        | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Store-Front      | Customer-facing UI for product browsing & orders |
| Store-Admin      | Admin UI for managing products & viewing orders  |
| Product-Service  | Handles product CRUD operations                  |
| Order-Service    | Sends order details to Azure Service Bus         |
| Makeline-Service | Consumes from Azure Service Bus and completes orders |
| AI-Service       | Uses GPT-4 for descriptions & DALL¬∑E for images  |
| MongoDB          | Stores product and order data                    |
